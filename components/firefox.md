## Notes


# Contributors list
Qronikarz(GitHub), 

[^1]: Firefox stores tags in bookmarks in it's own format (either HTML or JSON) which shouldn't require any file system specific features.
[^2]: Firefox displays a star when you open a website that is already bookmarked, but you can create duplicates by copying it in bookmarks window/panel. It also doesn't recognize ? and # parameters as the same website which means that when you change a chapter on the same page, firefox will not show that it is already saved.
