Qronikarz(GitHub), 

[^1]: Spacedrive comes with its own filesystem which is supposed to work cross-platform and doesn't depend on any file system specific features
[^2]: There is option to search using tag filter but it seems to work as "boolean OR" mode. So it shows all files tagged with those tags.
[^3]: Auto tagging is used in Labels. It's different from Tags which can only be created by users, but labels and tags otherwise work in similar way.
