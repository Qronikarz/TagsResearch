[^1]: Changing the file tags changes hash sums of the file. So even if the file name stays the same it changes the actual file in some way so it doesn't have the same hash sum.
[^2]: Certain file operations can get rid of the file tags. These include for example copying the file to file system other than NTFS or sending the files through email.
