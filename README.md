# Tags research
Knowledge base originally made for improving QuoMediaView, rewritten for public access. Goals are to provide useful information for developers able to implement tags and establish a new standard/specification that allows for file tagging on every major platform (or at least unify the Linux ones).

# Resources
[Tags Overview](components/tagsoverview.md) - Markdown file with an explanation of tagging systems in comparison with traditional folder based approach. Best for beginners.

[Tags Research](components/tagsresearch.md) - Markdown file with a collection of links and notes about general file tagging and all specification attempts from the past. More tailored for developers or users that are already using file tags.

[Glossary](components/glossary.md) - Markdown file with descriptions of features on single program pages.

[Software List](components/softwarelist.md) - Markdown file with a categorized collection of software that specialize in tagging. Previously available in main readme.md file, but moved for better clarity.

[Program Template](components/programtemplate.md) - Template for new programs that deal with files.

[Program Template nonfiles](components/programtemplate-nonfiles.md) - Template for new programs that don't deal with actual files. For example a to-do notes app or bookmark manager.

Suggestions for more appropriate license welcome.
Main goal is to have it available for others to copy and use it in other projects (including paid ones) - for example if somebody wants to convert it into something like Gitbook documentation then there should be no problems.
