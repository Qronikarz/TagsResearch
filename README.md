# Tags research
Knowledge base originally made for improving QuoMediaView, rewritten for public access. New goals are to provide useful information for developers able to implement tags and establish a new standard/specification that allows for file tagging on every major platform (or at least unify the Linux ones).

# Resources
[Tags Overview](components/tagsoverview.md) - Markdown file with an explanation of tagging systems in comparison with traditional folder based approach. Best for beginners.

[Tags Research](components/tagsresearch.md) - Markdown file with a collection of links and notes about general file tagging and all specification attempts from the past. More tailored for developers or users that are already using file tags.

[Glossary](components/glossary.md) - Markdown file with descriptions of features featured on single program pages.

[Software List](components/softwarelist.md) - Markdown file with a categorized collection of software that specialize in tagging. Previously available in main readme.md file, but moved for better clarity.

If there's a better license feel free to suggest it. Main goal was to have it available for copying and using it in other projects - like for example if somebody wants to convert it into something like Gitbook documentation then there should be no problems.
